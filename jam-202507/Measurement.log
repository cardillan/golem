Automatically added missing 'printflush(message1);' call to the end of the program.
     3 instructions before optimizations.
     1 instructions eliminated by Single Step Elimination (4 iterations).
     2 instructions after optimizations.

Modifications by Jumps phase, Single Step Elimination, pass 2, iteration 1 (-1 instructions):
     0 print "Hello"
     1 printflush message1
-    * end

Final code before resolving virtual instructions:

    0:  print "Hello"                                                print("Hello");
    1:  printflush message1                                          #set syntax = strict;
