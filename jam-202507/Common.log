     4 instructions before optimizations.
     1 instructions eliminated by Unreachable Code Elimination (2 iterations).
     3 instructions after optimizations.

Modifications by Jumps phase, Unreachable Code Elimination, pass 2, iteration 1 (-1 instructions):
 
     1 label *label2
     2 wait 1e12
     3 jump *label2 always
-    * end

Final code before resolving virtual instructions:

    0:  set *signature "0:v1"                                        #set target = 8;
        label *label2                                                ...
    1:  wait 1e12                                                    ...
    2:  jump *label2 always 0 0                                      ...

Program output (2 steps):
The program didn't generate any output.
Execution exception at instruction 1: wait 1e12:
Instruction not supported by Mindcode emulator.
(Use the '#set err-unsupported-opcode = false;' directive or the '--err-unsupported-opcode false' command line option to ignore this exception.)
