Program output (2 steps):
The program didn't generate any output.
Execution exception at instruction 1: wait 1e12:
Instruction not supported by Mindcode emulator.
(Use the '#set err-unsupported-opcode = false;' directive or the '--err-unsupported-opcode false' command line option to ignore this exception.)
