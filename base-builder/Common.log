     4 instructions before optimizations.
     1 instructions eliminated by Unreachable Code Elimination (2 iterations).
     3 instructions after optimizations.

Modifications by Jumps phase, Unreachable Code Elimination, pass 2, iteration 1 (-1 instructions):
 
     1 label *label2
     2 wait 1e12
     3 jump *label2 always
-    * end

Final code before resolving virtual instructions:

        label *label2                                                ...
    1:  wait 1e12                                                    ...
    2:  jump *label2 always 0 0                                      ...
