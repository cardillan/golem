    11 instructions before optimizations.
     1 instructions eliminated by Unreachable Code Elimination (2 iterations).
    10 instructions after optimizations.

Modifications by Jumps phase, Unreachable Code Elimination, pass 3, iteration 1 (-1 instructions):
 
     1 label *label2
     2 wait 1e12
     3 jump *label2 always
-    * end

Final code before resolving virtual instructions:
