     4 instructions before optimizations.
     1 instructions eliminated by Unreachable Code Elimination (2 iterations).
     3 instructions after optimizations.

Modifications by Jumps phase, Unreachable Code Elimination, pass 3, iteration 1 (-1 instructions):
 
     1 label *label0
     2 wait 1e12
     3 jump *label0 always
-    * end

Final code before resolving virtual instructions:

    2:  jump *label0 always 0 0                                      ...

Program output (2 steps):
The program didn't generate any output.
Execution exception at instruction 1: wait 1e12:
Instruction not supported by Mindcode emulator.
(Use the '#set err-unsupported-opcode = false;' directive or the '--err-unsupported-opcode false' command line option to ignore this exception.)
