    description = """
        Automated Impact Reactor Power Plant.
        Can automatically start the reactors when provided with blast compound, cryofluid and thorium
        (thorium is used to charge battery for cold startup, will use units to bring thorium from core).
        May switch off boosting or reactors when power demand is low (link the overdrive projector/dome to the lower right processor).
        Can be switched off manually, stars quickly if there is enough energy in battery storage.
        Provides early power output for cryofluid/blast compound factories (tower 1), full output to the rest of the base (tower 2).
        Can handle up to 12 reactors.
        To add reactors, copy the existing reactors and the bridges right next to them.
        Needs 2 additional large batteries per reactor linked to the central battery (not included in schematics).
        These batteries should be isolated from the rest of the power grid.
