# golem

A collection of [Mindcode and Schemacode](https://github.com/cardillan/mindcode/tree/devel) scripts.

Individual program/schematics are stored in separate folders, hopefully accompanied by some readme.

To compile Mindcode program into mlog, you can use the [web app](http://mindcode.herokuapp.com/). To compile Schematics files as they are here, you'll need [local installation of Mindcode](https://github.com/cardillan/mindcode/blob/devel/doc/syntax/TOOLS-IDE-INTEGRATION.markdown).
